The feature is designed to help organizations, schools and other private groups communicate in a more organized and structured way. Meta introduced Communities on WhatsApp back in 2022.\r\n\r\nThe feature lets people connect with others without needing an associated Facebook Group to do so. Meta rolled out Community Chats on Messenger back in 2022 as a way for people in Facebook Groups to connect in real-time, but with this new feature, the company is allowing people to create dedicated spaces for real-time communication on Messenger without being connected to a Facebook Group.\r\n\r\nThe launch indicates that Meta is looking to expand Messenger’s functionality and differentiate it from other messaging services, like iMessage. It also suggests that it wants to add a broader social networking aspect to the messaging app outside of Facebook by helping people find and connect with their community directly within Messenger.\r\n\r\nCommunities consolidate multiple group chats into one place, and each Community features a dedicated “Home” space where admins can share updates and announcements. Up to 5,000 people can join a community through shareable invites, Meta says. \r\n\r\nThe feature can be used to create a dedicated space for things like organizations, schools, PTAs and neighborhoods. It could also be used to create a dedicated space for connecting with friends with similar interests.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a neighborhood could create a Community to keep everyone connected and updated on different topics. They could create dedicated group chats for topics like upcoming events, security alerts, trash pickup schedules, and more. Or a school could create a Community and have dedicated group chats for all grades, allowing parents to join the conversations that concern their children.\r\n\r\nAlthough the feature works similarly to Communities on WhatsApp, Meta says there is one key differentiator, which is the fact that Messenger Communities are connected to Facebook’s social graph. While WhatsApp requires you to have someone’s phone number to invite them to a Community, Community builders on WhatsApp can grow their communities by inviting Facebook friends and friends of friends.</p>', 'GettyImages-2150540396.webp', 0, 0),

The companies didn’t disclose the terms of the deal but said that the Threads.com team will join Shopify.\r\n\r\nThreads added that after the launch of Meta’s social network with the same name last year, the startup had “the opportunity to sell our domains.” It is not clear if the startup sold the domain name to Meta, Shopify or anyone else, but the note does indicate that it would have had to rebrand from Threads had it remained independent. We have reached out to all these companies, and we’ll update the story if we hear back.\r\n\r\nThreads.com launched its product from stealth in 2019 with $10.5 million in funding. It was thrown into the limelight after Meta launched Threads, its Twitter-like social network. Notably, Meta also had another product named Threads, an Instagram companion app that started in 2019 and was shut down in 2021.\r\n\r\nThreads.com’s team said that while Meta’s social network was on the rise, a few companies approached the startup to acquire it. Eventually, it chose Shopify, it said, for the opportunity “to tinker at scale.”\r\n\r\n“Around the same time [when Threads.com was considering selling the domain], a handful of companies approached us, wondering if we would be open to an acquisition,” the company said in the post on its homepage. “When this happened in the past, we would politely decline. However, this time, things were different. We weren’t that excited about the time it would take to invest in a rebrand, and with mind-warping technological advances now being a commodity, we were excited about joining a place where we could tinker at scale.”\r\n\r\nLast year, Meta opted to use Threads.net because Threads, the business communication startup, already owned Threads.com. However, many customers still visited the .com website and even downloaded the startup’s app before realizing it wasn’t the social network they were looking for.\r\n\r\nAccording to data from analytics firm data.ai at the time, Threads.com’s app saw 880,000 downloads globally on iOS alone between July 6 and July 12. And on Android, the app crossed the mark of a million lifetime downloads with just a few downloads prior to Meta launching its Threads social network.</p>', 'Threads.com_.webp', 1, 0),

At least, that’s what happened to the founders of Kelvin, a French startup that is using computer vision and machine learning to make it easier to audit homes for energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nClémentine Lalande, Pierre Joly and Guillaume Sempé started looking at home energy efficiency audits because renovations are going to have a massive impact on reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. But, like the rest of the construction industry, most companies in this space don’t use technology to improve their processes.\r\n\r\n“There are 300 million homes to renovate over the next 30 years in Europe,” Lalande, Kelvin’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “But the construction industry is the second least-digitized sector after agriculture.”\r\n\r\nIn France, the National Housing Agency (ANAH) has set an ambitious goal of reaching 200,000 renovated homes in 2024 alone. But craftspersons simply can’t keep up, and it hurts the climate as a result. More generally, the regulatory landscape is favorable for this kind of startup in Europe.\r\n\r\nFounded in October 2023, Kelvin is a pure software play. The company doesn’t want to build a marketplace of service providers, and unlike Enter, another home energy assessment startup based in Germany that TechCrunch covered, it doesn’t want to be a customer-facing product either.\r\n\r\nInstead, the startup has put together a small team of engineers to create its own AI model specialized in home energy assessments using machine learning. The company uses open data, such as satellite images, as well as its own training data set with millions of photos and energy assessments.\r\n\r\n“We also do this on data we collect ourselves. We’ve developed a remote inspection tool with a bot that tells the person who is in there the photos and videos they should collect,” she added. “We then have models that count radiators in videos, detect doors, detect the ceiling height, and will determine the type of boiler or the ventilation unit.”\r\n\r\nKelvin doesn’t want to use 3D technologies like LiDAR because it wants to build a tool that can be used at scale. It lets you use normal photos and videos, which means that you don’t need a recent smartphone with a LiDAR sensor to record a room’s details.\r\n\r\nThe startup’s potential clients could be construction companies, the real estate industry, or even financial institutions that want to finance home renovation projects — financiers, in particular, might be looking for accurate assessments before they make a decision.\r\n\r\nIn the company’s first tests, its home energy assessments have been accurate within 5% of old-fashioned assessments. And if it becomes the go-to tool for these audits, it will become much easier to compare one home to another and one renovation to another.\r\n\r\nThe startup has now raised €4.7 million ($5.1 million at today’s exchange rate) with Racine² leading the round and a non-dilutive investment from Bpifrance. Seedcamp, Raise Capital, Kima Ventures, Motier Ventures and several business angels also participated in the round.</p>', 'GettyImages-1308318231.webp', 1, 0),

The program was limited to Facebook and Instagram until now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said merchants who subscribe to the plan on WhatsApp will get a badge and impersonation protection after sharing their business’ details with the company. These businesses will also get a verified WhatsApp channel for their marketing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The plan also lets businesses use their WhatsApp Business account from multiple devices. Plus, they get to create a custom web page with their business’ details that they can share with customers or vendors.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp already offers some of these features with&nbsp;<a href=\"#\">WhatsApp Premium</a>, which it started testing with a few businesses in some regions in 2022, but never extended the rollout to other markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta is also introducing the ability for users to call large businesses using WhatsApp through APIs — such as banks or airlines. For users, this will work like calling a customer support number, but through the app. Until now, WhatsApp Business users had to use their personal phone numbers to service customer calls.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">WhatsApp said it would charge companies for this service, but it hasn’t revealed any pricing details yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also incoming is <a href=\"#\">a personalized messaging service for businesses</a> that lets merchants send messages like coupon codes, information on new launches, or birthday wishes to customers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With more than 200 million monthly users on WhatsApp Business, Meta is trying to build a full suite of solutions that businesses can tap for communicating with their customers.

The company said existing commerce and payment services only cater to the top 200 million users.

Once you do that, you will get a streak badge displayed on the chat, along with the number of streak days. In the past few days, multiple users have posted on social media about seeing the TikTok’s streaks feature on their app.\r\n\r\nA streak ends when neither person sends messages in a chat within 24 hours of the last message.

The menu also provides an option for turning off in-app streak notifications.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Snapchat streaks are a status symbol among friends to prove how close you are to a person and how often you interact with them.

Because of the slowdown in venture funding, valuations have been more reasonable and firms have had more time to complete due diligence, he added. Plus, because consumer investing has gone out of fashion for years in the VC world, there’s less competition. “Those are two compounding factors that actually make us more excited to be investing right now,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some LPs have been hesitant to commit given higher interest rates and political uncertainty, Shapiro said that Collaborative’s investors didn’t fall into that category.&nbsp; “What we saw is that the more sophisticated LPs, who have a very long term view, understand that narrative. They understand that markets ebb and flow,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm had “significantly greater demand than we could accommodate,” said partner Sophie Bakalar. Part of that could be the fact that Collaborative has recently returned capital to its LPs, Shapiro said.
